# Known Limitations

## Current System Limitations

### Performance Constraints

#### Browser Limitations
- **WebGL Support**: Requires modern browser with WebGL 2.0 support
- **Memory Usage**: High memory consumption on lower-end devices
- **Mobile Performance**: Reduced frame rates on older mobile devices
- **Battery Drain**: Intensive 3D rendering impacts battery life

#### Rendering Limitations
- **Object Count**: Performance degrades with >100 dynamic objects
- **Texture Memory**: Limited by device GPU memory
- **Shader Complexity**: Complex shaders may cause frame drops
- **Shadow Quality**: Shadow resolution limited by performance requirements

### Feature Limitations

#### User Experience
- **Keyboard Only**: Primary interaction requires keyboard (mouse support limited)
- **Desktop Focused**: Mobile experience not fully optimized
- **No Persistence**: Scene customizations not saved between sessions
- **Limited Accessibility**: Screen reader and accessibility features incomplete

#### Content Creation
- **No User Upload**: Users cannot upload custom 3D models
- **Limited Customization**: Object parameters have fixed ranges
- **No Scene Editor**: No visual editor for creating custom scenes
- **Static Assets**: All assets are pre-bundled, no dynamic loading

### Technical Debt

#### Code Structure
- **Duplicate Utilities**: Type guards and utilities scattered across modules (being addressed in Phase 1)
- **Import Paths**: Inconsistent import path patterns
- **Component Coupling**: Some components tightly coupled to specific contexts
- **State Management**: Mix of Context and local state patterns

#### Testing
- **Test Coverage**: Incomplete test coverage for complex 3D components
- **E2E Testing**: Limited end-to-end testing for user interactions
- **Performance Testing**: No automated performance regression testing
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Manual testing only

### Infrastructure Limitations

#### Database
- **Single Database**: No database redundancy or backup strategy
- **Query Optimization**: Some queries not optimized for large datasets
- **Migration Strategy**: Manual migration management
- **Data Validation**: Limited server-side validation

#### Deployment
- **Single Environment**: No staging environment for testing
- **Manual Deployment**: No automated deployment pipeline
- **Monitoring**: Limited error tracking and performance monitoring
- **Backup Strategy**: No automated backup procedures

- ‚è≥ Accessibility improvements

### Phase 4 (Long-term)
- ‚è≥ Advanced testing infrastructure
- ‚è≥ Automated deployment pipeline
- ‚è≥ Comprehensive monitoring
- ‚è≥ Database optimization

## Workarounds

### Performance Issues
- **Reduce Object Count**: Limit number of active objects for better performance
- **Lower Quality Settings**: Use performance mode on slower devices
- **Browser Optimization**: Close other tabs and applications
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Ensure GPU acceleration is enabled

### Compatibility Issues
- **Browser Requirements**: Use Chrome, Firefox, or Safari (latest versions)
- **Mobile Usage**: Use in landscape mode for better experience
- **Memory Issues**: Refresh page if performance degrades
